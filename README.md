In this Repository you'll find my first tryouts with Selenium.
Therefore I use Eclipse MARS as IDE and Maven.

I work with the public available Mercury Tours application, which is also used by HPE and Mercury with QTP and UFT tutorials :)
The URL is http://newtours.demoaut.com/, Username and Password are "tutorial"
